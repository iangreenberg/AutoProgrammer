# Simple AutoProgrammer - Cursor Integration

I've created ultra-simple integration scripts that require **ZERO dependencies** and will work immediately.

## OPTION 1: Simple One-Time Finder (Easiest)

To quickly find and display the most recent output:

```bash
./simple-finder.sh
```

This will:
- Search your files for any recent AutoProgrammer outputs
- Display the content directly in your terminal
- Copy the content to your clipboard

## OPTION 2: Watch for New Files (Recommended)

To continuously monitor for new outputs:

```bash
./file-watcher.sh
```

This will:
- Watch for any new or changed files
- Immediately display new outputs when detected
- Copy the content to your clipboard
- Run continuously until you press Ctrl+C

## OPTION 3: Full Integration with Regular Updates

For a complete integration solution:

```bash
./simple-cursor-integration.sh
```

This will:
- Aggressively search for any AutoProgrammer outputs
- Display them directly in your terminal
- Continuously check for new outputs every few seconds
- Copy outputs to your clipboard
- Create a local copy of outputs for Cursor

## Why These Are Better

These new scripts:
1. Require NO dependencies (just bash)
2. Work immediately without setup
3. Run directly in your Cursor terminal
4. Are much simpler and more reliable

## Troubleshooting

If you're not seeing outputs:

1. Make sure AutoProgrammer has actually generated an output
2. Try running `./simple-finder.sh` to immediately find any outputs
3. Look at the list of files it finds and check if your output is among them

The scripts automatically search in:
- Your current directory
- Your Desktop folder
- The autoprogrammer-desktop directory (if it exists)
