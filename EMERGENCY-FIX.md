# EMERGENCY FIX

Since the previous solutions aren't working, I've created the absolute simplest possible approach.

## TRY THIS FIRST:

**Double-click this file:**
```
last-resort.command
```

This is an extremely simplified script that:
- Searches for ANY .txt files on your Desktop and current folder
- Shows any text file modified in the last 10 minutes
- Doesn't try to do anything fancy or complex
- Uses minimal commands that will work on any Mac

## IF THAT DOESN'T WORK:

1. **Open Terminal** (you can search for "Terminal" in Spotlight)

2. **Navigate to the AutoProgrammer folder** (where these scripts are)
   - If the folder is on your Desktop, use:
   ```
   cd ~/Desktop/AutoProgrammer
   ```

3. **Run the super simple script:**
   ```
   ./super-simple.sh
   ```

## FOR TESTING:

I created a test file you can modify to check if the integration is working:
```
test-output.txt
```

Just edit this file (add some text and save it), and the scripts should detect the change and display the contents.

## WHY THIS SHOULD WORK:

These scripts are:
- Absolute minimal versions with almost no logic
- No dependencies whatsoever
- Just using basic Unix commands available on every Mac
- Checking for ANY text files (not just specific patterns)
- Providing clear output and progress indicators

Keep the terminal window open while using AutoProgrammer - all outputs should appear there.
